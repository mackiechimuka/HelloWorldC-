# Overview

This is a simple Hello World program to test if my development kit such as github ,git and vs code is working so I can finally work on my projects

# Development Environment

For this program I used VS Community as my text editor for writing my code and I have used Git as a source control for tracking and managing software code changes and I have used Github as a repository for my program.

I used C# AND .NET framework.

# Useful Websites


* I didn't use any website since I already knew how to create the program.
